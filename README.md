# Game7 DAO Contracts Repository

Welcome to the Game7 DAO Contracts repository. This repository contains all the contracts that are part of the Game7 DAO ecosystem. The contracts in this repository cover various aspects of our ecosystem, ensuring a robust and efficient decentralized environment for our users.

## Submodules

This repository is organized into several submodules, each representing a different set of contracts within the ecosystem:

1. **Protocol** - [Submodule URL](git@github.com-g7:G7DAO/protocol)
2. **NFT Inventory** - [Submodule URL](git@github.com-g7:G7DAO/nft-inventory)
3. **Achievo Contracts** - [Submodule URL](git@github.com-g7:G7DAO/achievo-contracts)

## Development Status

Please note that this repository is currently under active development. During the development process, the repository is kept private to ensure the security and integrity of our codebase.

We are committed to transparency and open-source principles. Therefore, once the development phase is complete and the contracts have been thoroughly tested and audited, we will make the repository public. This will allow the community to review, contribute, and benefit from our work.
